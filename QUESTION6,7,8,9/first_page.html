    <h1>How to set up a Wi-fi network</h1>
    <p>The Internet is a really powerful tool. It gives us access to all kinds of information at a moment's noticeâ€”think email,
    Google search, and Wikipedia. So there's something a little counterintuitive about only being able to use the Internet
    when you sit down at a desktop computer. What if you could use the Internet from anywhere in your home or office?</p>
    <p>If you already have high-speed (broadband) Internet service at your house, it's pretty easy to create your own home
    wireless network. Commonly known as Wi-Fi, a wireless network allows you to connect laptops, smartphones, and other
    mobile devices to your home Internet service without an Ethernet cable.</p>

        <li>Configure your router</li>
        <li>Connect!</li>
    </ul>
