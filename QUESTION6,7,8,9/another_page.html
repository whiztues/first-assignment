    <h1>Wireless router</h1>
    <p>To create your own Wi-Fi network, you'll need a wireless router. This is the device that will broadcast the Wi-Fi signal
    from your Internet modem throughout your house. Your Internet service provider (ISP) may offer you a wireless router for
    a small monthly fee. If you've never set up a Wi-Fi network before, this may be the easiest option.</p>
